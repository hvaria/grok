# Grok

Grok is an innovative machine learning toolkit designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of model training and evaluation. By providing advanced tools for data processing, performance measurement, and result visualization, Grok simplifies the complexities involved in developing and fine-tuning machine learning models.

## Purpose

The primary aim of Grok is to offer a streamlined workflow for machine learning practitioners, enabling them to achieve better model performance with less manual effort. Whether you're conducting research, developing predictive models, or exploring new machine learning techniques, Grok provides the necessary tools to accelerate your work.

## Installation

To install Grok, pip to install the project in editable mode. This allows you to modify the Grok code on-the-fly and have the changes reflected immediately.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Training a Model

To start training a model using Grok, simply run the `train.py` script located in the `scripts` directory. This script is designed to be flexible, supporting various training configurations and model types.

```bash
./scripts/train.py 
```

You can customize the training process by adjusting the script's parameters according to your needs.

### Exploring Further

For more detailed examples and guides on how to use Grok's features, please refer to the Jupyter notebooks located in the `nbs` folder. These notebooks provide in-depth tutorials and examples on how to use Grok for a wide range of machine learning tasks.
